                    <p>This module carries on where <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps" target="_blank">CSS first steps</a> left off — now that you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>
                    <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text" target="_blank">text styling</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout" target="_blank" >CSS layout</a>.</p>

                            The aim of this lesson is to develop your understanding of some of the most fundamental concepts of CSS — the cascade, specificity, and inheritance — which control how CSS is applied to HTML and how conflicts are resolved.

                            There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style. In this article and its sub-articles, we'll run through the different types in great detail, seeing how they work. The sub-articles are as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Type, class, and ID selectors</li>

                        <p>
                            Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a proper look at the CSS Box Model, in order that you can move onto more complex layout tasks with an understanding of how it works and the terminology that relates to it.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In recent years, CSS has evolved in order to better support different directionality of content, including right-to-left but also top-to-bottom content (such as Japanese) — these different directionalities are called writing modes. As you progress in your study and begin to work with layout, an understanding of writing modes will be very helpful to you, therefore we will introduce them in this article.

                            In this lesson we will look at another important concept in CSS — overflow. Overflow is what happens when there is too much content to be contained comfortably inside a box. In this guide, you will learn what it is and how to manage it.

                            In the various lessons so far you have come across a number of ways to size items on a web page using CSS. Understanding how big the different features in your design will be is important, and in this lesson, we will summarize the various ways elements get a size via CSS and define a few terms around sizing that will help you in the future.

                            In this lesson we will take a look at how certain special elements are treated in CSS. Images, other media, and form elements behave a little differently in terms of your ability to style them with CSS than regular boxes. Understanding what is and isn't possible can save some frustration, and this lesson will highlight some of the main things that you need to know.
